# Code Katas
A series of short programs in python, based on katas from Code Wars.

## Problem 1: Return Negative.
Module Name: return_negative.py
Test Module Name: test_return_negative.py
Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/55685cd7ad70877c23000102/train/python
Best solution: 
```python
This was the solution by staticor, axwalker (plus 179 more warriors):
def make_negative(number):
    return -abs(number)
```

## Problem 2: Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List
Module Name: minmax.py
Test Module Name: test_minmax.py
Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/577a98a6ae28071780000989/train/python
Best solution:
```python
def m(arr):
    return min(arr)

def m(arr):
    return max(arr)
```
*Note- I did not think you could use the actual min/ max functions for this!*
